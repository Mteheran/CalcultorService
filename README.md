# CalcultorService
Calculator service using a console client and an API as a sever

1. To debug, just play the application

Notes:

- because of the time I couldn't add the log to the API
- The class JournalDatabase is a representtion of a realdatabase using a abstract component implementing the interface
- I used the easy way to return the results of the operations
- it is posible to do many things better but because of the time I can't do it
- I could explain better the architecture in a meeting
